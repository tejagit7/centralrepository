 hi this is github file that is created in central repo
.
always check if the capslock is enbaled or disabled

to add branch u can also use git checkout branch name [ajet]

to delete the branch use git -d bramch name [ajet]

iam having a trouble on accessing the password for git or for tokens usage the pasting is not working in the work directory

iam practicing the git push and pull commands 

after editing or adding on the file use git add file name to it and then use git commit -m name of the commit to it [ajet]
